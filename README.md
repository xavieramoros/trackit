# How to run the app
To run the app, follow these steps:

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies using yarn install
- Start the app using yarn start
- Use the Expo client app to run the app on a physical device or an emulator
Note: You may need to have the Expo CLI installed globally on your system to run the app.

# How to run tests
To run tests, follow these steps:

- Make sure the app is not running
- Run yarn test in the terminal
- The tests should run and show the results in the terminal
Note: You may need to have the Expo CLI and Jest testing framework installed globally on your system to run the tests.

# Technolgies
This is a React-Native app built using Expo. The app includes the following technologies: React Navigation, TypeScript, Redux, Redux Persist, React Native Elements, and React Native Toast Message.

## Expo
Expo is a development tool that makes it easy to build and deploy React Native apps. It provides a set of tools and services to help you build, test, and publish your app, as well as simplify common development tasks.

## React Navigation
React Navigation is a library that provides a way to navigate between screens and manage navigation state in a React Native app. It supports various types of navigation such as stack, tab, and drawer navigation.

## TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It provides better tooling and can help catch errors before runtime.

## Redux
Redux is a state management library that provides a predictable way to manage the state of your application. It helps in creating scalable, testable, and maintainable code.

## Redux Persist
Redux Persist is a library that helps in persisting the Redux store to local storage. This allows the app to retain the state even after the app is closed or the device is restarted.

## React Native Elements
React Native Elements is a library of UI components for React Native. It provides a set of pre-built, customizable components that can be used to quickly build a polished UI for your app.

## React Native Toast Message
React Native Toast Message is a library that provides a way to show toast messages in a React Native app. It allows developers to show simple messages to users for a short period of time.

## React Native Testing Library
React Native Testing Library is a library that provides a set of utilities for testing React Native components. It allows developers to write tests that closely resemble how the user interacts with the app.

## Future improvements

- Allow to edit the categories of existing activity.
- Add backend and save data to the cloud (Firebase could be a good option).
- Allow to include a text for each activity.
